## About Google CSSI
I was selected to participate in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute during my Senior year of High School where I spent 3 weeks at Google Chicago HQ learning the fundamentals of Computer Science and using Google Cloud Products through Google Software Engineers.

The technical skills I aquired were HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX + Datastore, API, and hosting projects through Google App Engine.

Aside from gaining technical skills, I learned about soft skills and understanding the corporate life about Google which piqued my interested in program and product management. I even learned about professional and personal branding which I apply to my daily life.
